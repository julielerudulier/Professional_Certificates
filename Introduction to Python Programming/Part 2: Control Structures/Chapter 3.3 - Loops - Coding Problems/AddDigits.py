#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#a_string is a string of random characters. Write some code
#that adds all the digits that appear in the string and prints
#their sum.
#
#For example, the digits in the string above are 1, 2, 2, and 5,
#so your code would print 10.
#
#Remember, you can iterate over each character in a string with
#this syntax:
#
#for a_character in a_string:
#
#Remember also, you can check if a character is in a list of other
#characters within this syntax:
#
#if a_character in "ABCDEFG":
#
#If there are no digits in the string, print 0.


#Add your code here!

sum = 0

for i in a_string:
    if i.isdigit():
        sum += int(i)
